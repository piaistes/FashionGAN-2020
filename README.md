# FashionGAN-This fashion item does not exist (yet)!
This is an invitation to anyone who would like to play with state-of-the-art-AI tools 
to take advantage of this repository, creating never-seen-before fashion items!

No need for extra  GPU's! All training process is done in Google-Colab Free Version!
